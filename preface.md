# An Argument Towards Reform
*An argument towards reform - a manifesto for change.*

Systems are fashioned by their parts and the wider context they act in. As part of one, we can and should mould it - together, through what we believe is right or wrong, by what we want to be - and more importantly what experiences we want future generations to have decades, or centuries in the future. Humanity has an opportunity to reach greatness, but if we don’t put enough time and thought into where we place our feet we could stumble along a different path.

The decision to mould ourselves, and society is not so simple as what moral principles to follow. Though morality is important, the changes can be a very passive act. By a series of accidents and discoveries we have created the system we live in. 

*If we collectively decide to remake it, then it must change…*

Compromise is of course necessary, without it will be hard to make any progress, trapped in a constant swirl of wasted actions.

We need to look at how to fashion our system in a way that creates long term improvement in metrics that actually matter. This may not be measured in financial gains for the few, but in a general standard of life and opportunities offered for all.

*Humanity has possibilities that way beyond what any of us can conceive now — to reach for the stars may not be science fiction in the future.*

All people will not have equal outcome in any system and nor should they. People should be rewarded for doing things that are of benefit. Those that don’t work for common good, should have the opportunity to do so, but no reward should come without effort.
 
*Cold pushed us to build shelter. The system needs to push us to strive for better.*

The capitalist system is a good example of a ‘reward’ system. People are rewarded for taking risks, finding productivity improvements, and creating real lasting technological improvements to society. This system however has flaws — it can overlook key metrics of long-term human wellbeing, the intangibles of cultural pursuit and creativity. It can be too focused on [short term gains](./general/long-termism), because short-term rewards can are amenable to human instinct. Short-termism however leads to ever reducing gains.

Although free-market capitalism has been successful at finding growth over the last centuries, how do we know it is still guiding us in the right direction? How can we realign our system to the direction we want?

Resistance to a status quo is likely to occur in any system. Push back and opposition is not a bad thing — sometimes resistance demonstrates that things need to change, and any system should listen to the voices of its citizens. Deciding the line carefully between natural opposition and protest, and what counts as criminality can be a hard line to walk. It is the line that separates despotic and free regimes. 

If behaviour is expected to cause damage to others, we should carefully weigh up the cost, before cracking down hard. Some behaviour is negative to society, and when behaviour causes damage to others, the cost of the restriction of the freedom of one has to be carefully balanced against the damage they can cause to others.

Sometimes people break the rules not because they particularly oppose them, but because they think they can get a better deal outside the lines.

Sometimes people can be rehabilitated and shown a new path, where they can contribute, and harness their energy in a better direction. If not, then unfortunately re-integration could compromise the health of the rest of the system, and here prisons or alternative measures should be used to isolate these members.

No system is perfect and there will always be crevices people to fall into.

What looks like a risk to a system may instead be an opportunity to adapt to the changing status quo. A system should not act to restrict opposition speech lest it become stagnant.
