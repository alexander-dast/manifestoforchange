Aiming to put home first. Our aim is to make the housing market sustainable, by providing and maintaining properties that are built with purpose in mind. Houses and land shouldn't be for profit, they are a place for people to rest and recuperate so that we can build tomorrow together.

- HMO-targeted building (young-professional targeted flat blocks/townhouses - getting people onto the property ladder)
- Affordable family homes

Targetting of: sustainable areas where houses don't just come with roads but with all the other moving parts - restaurants, shops, schools, doctors.
