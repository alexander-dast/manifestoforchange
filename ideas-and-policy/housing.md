# Housing 
The housing market is broken. Houses are too expensive, and are seen as a luxury instead of the necessity that they are

We need to put home first, whether as a government centred initiative or something built under something like the [Tythe](./tythe.qmd) foundation.

Our aim is to make the housing market sustainable, by providing and maintaining properties that are built with purpose in mind. Houses and land shouldn't be for profit, they are a place for people to rest and relax so that we can build tomorrow together.

- HMO-targeted building (young-professional targeted flat blocks/townhouses - getting people onto the property ladder). There is a real lack of HMOs now with it being necessary for most young-professionals to house-share under a dwindling number of HMO licenced properties
- More affordable family homes - we need to make it possible to afford a family home, where people can afford to bring up children.
- Nice places for people downsize to - good transport links and local shops, community atmosphere.

Important to this is areas where houses don't just come with roads but with all the other moving parts - restaurants, shops, schools, doctors - a real working community.
