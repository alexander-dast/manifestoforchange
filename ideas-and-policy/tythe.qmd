A giving pact of 10% of post-tax income into a charitable/non-profit foundation:

Donations are divided between:
- beneficial charitable organisations (where the most benefit/Â£ reaches the right people)
- community causes and infrastructure (see [Infrastructure Bank](<Infrastructure Bank.md>)?)
- Tythe projects (projects where there isn't an existing alternative but where there seems to be a need).
- 5% to a top-up fund (which aims to fill shortfalls where necessary and long-term planning of the organisation)

The Tythe organisation should be as streamlined as possible so a majority of the input goes to real impact.

People are more motivated when they see the benefit of their actions, so focus has to be made on impact investing, however long-term projects shouldn't be ignored. Most problems cannot be solved in a few days

The aim of the fund should be to create benefit locally, nationally and globally. 
We can't ignore global problems, but certainly the local problems will be more cost-effective to solve first, since the cause has the most understanding of these.
