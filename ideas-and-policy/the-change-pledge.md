# The Change Pledge
At manifestoforchange.org.uk we aim to promote discussion on ideas that can advance humanity in a way that is via discourse, debate and acceptance, rather than populism, exclusion and a stubborn neccesity to tow a party line. We may disagree on some issues, but we agree on the need to make the world a better place as a community.

As a stepping stone to making changes on a global level we look to home in the UK.

There is no one ideology or set of policies that has been proven to make society a better, fairer place - instead various policies from various parts of the 'spectrum' are implemented, each bringing changes good and bad. 

Institutions were built to make a difference, to solve problems, but when they entrench a new, but still very *imperfect* status quo, it may be time to give them a proper rethink, rather then bathing in apathy and slowly walking towards decline.

## This Change Pledge aims to be a real way to garner change via three mechanisms:
- Experts (and anyone interested) debate and discuss real pragmatic policy ideas via the manifestoforchange.org.uk platform (and associated discussion platforms). Before an election a simple set of achievable pledges along with research and suggestions towards their implementation is given.
	- The public should be involved in discussion since every policy affects people good and bad. It's about weighing up impact and making decisions that brings us all forward, while ensuring that those who are worse impacted are not left behind.
- MPs and politicians sign The Change Pledge, a policy paper set at encouraging real term change. From within parliament this group push forwards these policies to advance our society, moving us away from tinkering towards enacting change.
