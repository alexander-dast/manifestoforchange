    "text": "Preface\nAn argument towards reform.\nSystems are fashioned by their parts and the wider context they act in. As constituents of one, we can therefore mould it - together, through what we believe is right or wrong, by what we want ourselves to be - and more importantly what experiences we want future generations to have decades, or centuries in the future. Humanity has an opportunity to reach greatness, but equally could end in pain and misery.\nThe decision to mould ourselves, and society is not so simple as what what moral principles to follow - this is a very passive act. Humanity created the system we live in, and if we collectively decide to remake it, then so it will be. Compromise is necessary, without it it will be hard to make any progress, trapped in a constant swirl of wasted actions.\nWe need to look at how to fashion our system in a way that creates long term improvement in metrics that actually matter. This may not be measured in financial gains for the few, but in a general standard of life and opportunities offered for all, and progress towards the goal of striving ever higher. Humanities has possibilities way beyond what we can conceive now, if only we strived.\nIn no means does this mean that all people should have equal outcome. It is imperative not to ignore our own nature. Biologically we have evolved to reward ourselves (chemically) towards goals leading to self-preservation, and we should build a society that acts in a similar way. Rewards for things that are of benefit (and vice versa punishment for failing to act towards common good). Positivity is always the preference, but the persuasive power of the negative can not be ignored.\nCold pushed us to build shelter. The system needs to push us to strive for greatness.\nThe capitalist system is a good example of a ‘reward’ system. People are rewarded for taking risks, finding cost-cuts and growth in productivity, creating real lasting technological improvements to society. But in tandem this system can also overlook key metrics of long-term human wellbeing. It can be too focused on short term gains, because short-term rewards can be persuasive to human instinct. Short-termism however can lead to ever reducing gains. Capitalism, indadvertently may be a system that takes advantage of our very nature for transient gains, and although it has been successful at finding growth over the last centuries, without careful observation and adjustment, how do we know it is still guiding us in the right direction?\nThis short-termism does raise a question. How do we provide motivation for long-term gains, when we may not be alive in the long-term? Do people care about a future they won’t exist within? Global warming is a common example, why cut fossil fuels if you won’t feel their impact.\nBad apples are common to find in any system. Before rot sets in and spreads, they should be separated from the tree, for its own protection. If they can be rehabilitated, this should be attempted. If not, then unfortunately re-ntegration would compromise the health of the rest of the system.\nNo system is perfect and there will always be crevices for people to fall into. Retribution and blame is a useless tool, though is a part of our emotional retinue. Instead we should look towards righting the wrongs, and giving people who are able to take it a track back onto the right path.\nWe should be wary of seeing a bad apple where it is merely a pear. What looks like a risk to a system may instead be an opportunity to adapt to the changing status quo. Be wary of judging too soon without critical thought.",

    "text": "Long-lasting thinking\nShort term thinking is a byproduct of our inherent desire for material goods. But happiness is built in the long-term when our children have noticeably better lives than ourselves. This means we have to sacrifice some of our material-desires to fund the future. ### Infrastructure #### Essentials first Houses are essential and all people deserve at minimum a place to live and food to eat. Eventually there should be a system that makes this attainable for everyone. This requires mass building, and eventually the market will likely be a combination of the private-market (ownership, renting) and council houses (owned by the state). Council houses being the necessary stepping stone for the escape of the poverty trap.\nThe size of this place could then be a product of their hard-work. #### Ownership from source All resources possible should be able to be extracted and refined within the UK at a minimum level - keeping expertise in the UK workforce, and infrastructure and materials for all scenarios. I.e. coal mines and steel manufacturing should be subsidised to ensure there is a minimal provision. Similarly for any other important natural resources that we can process/extract. Whether this minimum provision is 1% (more/less) or if this provision is exported at a net-loss, this is still an important to the economic strength and independence of the UK. #### Investment Long term thinking requires investment that starts now, and plans for 10, 20, 30 years into the future. As the Chinese Proverb goes - “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” ### Planning & Government & Enterprise Allowing people the freedom to come up with their own idea, act on it, and reap the rewards of their risk, is an important part on motivating hard work and creativity. Possibly even those who act once, won’t just have one innovation and will be ‘serial’ inventors, their previous rewards help to fuel a chain reaction of ‘creation’.\nThere is however the effect that people think from a short-term frame, invent now, take profit. Relax on the profit they have generated. Investors can be motivated by these short term time frames, always looking for the next ‘fad’ to make a short term gain on. We need to seriously look at how we can encourage companies to invest in the future rather then practices like price-gouging, ‘layoffs’ focused on increasing profit margin rather then innovation. Intervention by ‘Sovereign wealth funds’ & even motivating individuals to take a stake may provide companies with a guiding force towards long term growth.",

There are lots of intelligent people but also lots of movement towards the United States. It is unlikely that we will be able to compete further in most industries but we need an industrial strategy to allow us to compete on a global scale in at least a few industries. We likely can not compete on wage so we must instead compete on an ideological, cultural, and the general standard-of-life. The UK may not be able to pay the most but it can offer other intangible assets. ### Prisoners Responsibility Prison should not be a place to wait out the sentence ascribed. It is a necessary solution to the problem of protecting society from those who would damage it. For high-risk prisoners there is likely nothing that can be done to rehabilitate and reintegrate and they should be isolated from society for the rest of their lives. If they can provide benefit to our society, then let them, but if we cannot be sure they will not cause serious irreversible harm we cannot release them. To do so would be to renege on the responsibility of ‘government’ to society.\nA large proportion of the prisoners are lower-risk and although they have caused damage to society, they have an opportunity to reintegrate and overtime be a net-positive, or at least reduce the net harm they have generated. This reintegration should be done both inside prison and outside. Prisoners should work for the society they have damaged through ‘optional labour’ giving them skills and training they may not already have, providing recompense for their actions. Since the end goal is no re-offense, prison can offer a place to get their feet on the ground, skill-up, and settle into work so release isn’t such a hard jump. Once out of the prison they continue repaying their debt to society by hard work with no continuing criminal enterprise.",

    "text": "The power of a country is down to it’s military, economy and diplomatic influence. The United States for example is (was?1) powerful because of it’s strength in all three. A country like the UK has economic and military power, but in the long-term it’s relative position in these areas is waning due to it’s size and the growth of previous underdeveloped economies.\nThe power of a country then contributes to how sovereign it can act on a global scale. Although most countries are ‘independent’ they have less power over what they do then their citizens may believe. Other countries can have large influences through direct economic (i.e. tarrifs and trade pact) or military control or via third party control (diplomatic relations), decreasing the ability of these countries to self-govern.\n\n[!EXAMPLE] UK At one point it had a large global influence (superpower status), and had much power over what direction it (and the world) headed. As this status faded as a consequence of the deterioration of the empire, its own ability to exercise it’s will on a global and local scale also decreases. It is now more beholden to the choices of foreign powers, whether this be via tariffs, making policy decisions to gain favourable trade, or many other ways in which it sacrifices its decision making for ‘progress’.\n\nIn many cases collective power allows stronger decisions making, and therefore it may make sense to form military or economic pacts with other like-minded nations, and use this combined power to collectively bargain and increase sovereignty. While to individual nations (and the citizens) this may seem like a sacrifice of sovereignty, if properly implemented (with good devolution), it could actually provide these nations with more effective sovereignty.",

It should likely also provide infrastructure that makes it easier to work, i.e. access to electricity, internet and transport if a competitive market structure isn’t efficient.\nIt should not provide so much that we ignore the human systems that would motivate work for the betterment of society.

To place our approach on an axes is instead of looking left and right, to be looking forwards to creating a better shared future, within this attempting to approach issues for the long-term not just the short-term.\nPerhaps this could be described as pragmatic progressivism, though getting bogged down in political definitions is counter to the mission of change. ## Some Plans For The Future 1.

It should be full of thoughts for how we can enact ‘real change’ to the system we live in. It is focused towards the United Kingdom, but really the ideas should be applicable anywhere.\nKey to this is that prospective collaborators go into the project with a mentality of ambitious compromise.\nTo attempt to define what this means: 1. your ideals won’t always appeal to the majority and implementation may not be feasible, so be open to discussion 2. compromise isn’t a bad thing, in fact it means finding a solution that works 3. compromise doesn’t have to mean a worse idea, perhaps it even means finding a better solution to a problem.\nChange isn’t easy and requires work and sacrifice, both in developing the ideas and in the implementation\nA real issue in discourse at the moment is the ability to accept two things at once. There isn’t one clear solution to world issues, no matter how easy it is for us to look for quick fixes.\nSometimes the political landscape leads to apathy, and a feeling that things can’t change. But this is self-fulfilling.\nIdeally this set of information should be a record of ideas, and the discussion, explanation and research that has gone into making them. The actual process of making that happen is not complete, so some work will have to go into the actual technical side of making this vision possible, read more on this README.\nApproach discusses the ‘system’ with which this project should be approached."
