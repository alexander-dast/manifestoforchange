# What could change look like?
How do we endeavour to create change that is popular while being successful? It is important to assess what we believe is important to a successful system.

1. Motivates us to strive for success and be creative, to work on our hobbies and innovate.
2. Motivates us to do the hard but necessary jobs.
3. Provides us a safety net so while we are growing as people, we aren’t worrying about health and comfort. (Houses, Food, Electricity, Water, Gas, Transport, Travel)
4. Provides us opportunities to gain the skills necessary so we can do 1 and 2.
5. A system where people look out for eachother. 

We are going to have to assess that we will look at the government expenditure and each decide that we don’t like a small part of it. But that small part will differ person to person. What is a good % of our tax that people should be happy about. Should this be a set number?
