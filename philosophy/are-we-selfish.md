Recently it feels that we are becoming more selfish then ever - in many facets. Common cause seems so distant to all of us - we see government, even local council as a monolith ruling over us, rather then a means to help us work towards common gains.

Those who earn lots feel they are overtaxed.
Those who are retired feel like they deserve to get out because they put in.
Those who are starting work feel the system is stacked against them.

So how do we make our systems begin to work for all of us again. We need to come to the centre and actually discuss, communicate and share what would make all of our lives better.

A healthier population is better for everyone?
Efficient and working infrastructure is better for everyone?
Having somewhere to live that is warm is better for everyone? Right? [Housing co-op or non-profit](../ideas-and-policy/housing.md)

Its true that structures that were put in place to benefit us now feel like they take advantage of us. We are losing trust in the institutions that run our society.

Social media preys on us, amplifying our differences rather then our common cause. The wealth-controlling class (not in entirety) uses it's resources not for human benefit but to keep the status quo. The government sends a good message, but seems unwilling to make the hard decisions that will make us sustainable.

Renting is broken.
The digital revolution is causing rapid change to society.

Are we anti-tax because:
- We don't trust the government to put our best interests to mind
- We don't want to share the benefits

Why are people so anti-student loans?
- Do we not believe in our education system?
