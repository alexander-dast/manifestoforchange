### Infrastructure
#### Essentials first
Houses are essential and all people deserve at minimum a place to live and food to eat. Eventually there should be a system that makes this attainable for everyone. This requires mass building, and eventually the market will likely be a combination of the private-market (ownership, renting) and council houses (owned by the state). Council houses being the necessary stepping stone for the escape of the poverty trap.
  
 The size of this place, and the luxury ascribed could then be a product of their hard-work.
#### Ownership from source
All resources possible should be able to be extracted and refined within the UK at a minimum level - keeping expertise in the UK workforce, and infrastructure and materials for all scenarios. I.e. coal mines and steel manufacturing should be subsidised to ensure there is a minimal provision. Similarly for any other important natural resources that we can process/extract. Whether this minimum provision is 1% (more/less) or if this provision is exported at a net-loss, this is still an important to the economic strength and independence of the UK.
#### Investment
Long term thinking requires investment that starts now, and plans for 10, 20, 30 years into the future. As the Chinese Proverb goes - "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
