# Website Structure

This website is broken down into three, slightly intertwined sections:

### 1. analysis & discussion. 
all analysis and discussion of the way things work currently, whether this is analysis of tax policy or discussions of demographic shift.

### 2. ideas & policies.  
this section describes things that could be changed - with this may be some intrinsic analysis and links to section 1.

### 3. philosophy.  
this provides a section for much more general discussion of ideas from a more top down general viewpoint.

Some topics won't fit exactly in one section but they should be best placed (without too much thought) and links between pages should provide the real structure of the website.
